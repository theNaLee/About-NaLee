Hello! My name is NaLee and it is great to meet YOU! 
I am studying at Fox Valley Technical College for my Software Developer Associate Degree. I will be graduating in 2025! After finishing my degree, I will be transferring to get a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 

My favorite color is orange! I love jellyfishes and birds (as long as they are not pigeons). I love to read, write, and play video games!

Feel free to check out my portfolio of all the project and codes I have worked on! 

You can contact me by emailing: Naleechang@gmail.com
